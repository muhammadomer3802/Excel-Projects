<h3> 1. US Presidents </h3>
This report is based on a dataset that included extensive information on US presidents, predominately highlighting their party affiliations, past experiences, and salaries. The data was first prepared and cleaned, and then pivot tables were made based on a set of prior questions. The information in the pivot tables was then visualised through the use of bar and pie charts. Finally, a report was made that included all the required information and related visualisations.
